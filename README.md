# Change of Plans

I cannot go through everything that I have listed below unless I do a very general overveiw so I am instead going to focus on learning how to use the following in depth:
  - ~~t-tests~~
  - ANOVA
  - Effect size (focus on Hedge's g, Cohen's d, and r^2)
  - Forest plots
  - If I have time left over, I will jump into factor analysis (because this looks really cool)
  
My new timeline is as follows:
  - Thursday
    - t-tests
    - ANOVA
  - Friday
    - More ANOVA
    - Effect size
  - Saturday
    - More effect size
    - Forest plots
  - Sunday
    - More forest plots
    - Prepare talk for in class
  - Monday
    - Factor analysis
  - Tuesday
    - More factor analysis

### NOTE
Main CODE is the condenced version of "show your work" CODE. I have not data sets. No other files on this repo are relevent. I cannot figure out how to get the figure save thing to work... as you will see


# See previous plan below


## Goals


~~1.) Figure out how to simulate data (include every variable type and subtype)~~

2.) Gain a conceptual understanding of the following statistical tools (and play with them in R):
  - a.) T-tests (one and two sample)
  - b.) Uni vs. multi variate ANOVO
  - c.) Factor analysis
  - d.) Structural equation modeling
  - e.) Inter-rater reliability
  - f.) Linear regressions and corrilation coefficents
  - g.) Hedge's g calculation and z-scores for standardized mean difference
  - h.) "leave-one-out" analysis
  - i.) Specificity scores
  - j.) Tests of homogeneity
    - I.) Q-tests
    - II.) Chi-squared tests
    - III.) I-squared
    - IV.) Tau-squared

3.) Run each of the above tests with my simulated data in R

4.) Determine when to use the following graphs and create an elegent example of each in R (using simulaed data0
  - a.) Scatter-plot
  - b.) Histogram
  - b.) Mosiac plot
  - d.) Bar plot
  - e.) Frequency distribuion
  - f.) Density distribution
  - g.) Forest Plots
  
5.) If I complete all of the above, I will look a aggregated effect sizes (fixed and random analysis)

## Statment of Standards


In order to keep on top of my deliveribles, I will: 
  - Annotate all code while writing it (something I should be doing already but I am not)
  - Take (actually useable) notes while learning about the uses of statistical tests
  - Make a running list of all sources I look at the moment I download it
  - Use proper file directory procedures (even though I hate it)
  - Push to GitHub.com after every sitting
  - If I get to part 5, take notes on everything I do so I don't get lost in the complexity
  - Strike out sections in this read me as I complete them
