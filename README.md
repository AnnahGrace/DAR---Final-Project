# Goals


1.) Figure out how to simulate data (include every variable type and subtype)

2.) Gain a conceptual understanding of the following statistical tools (and play with them in R):
  -a.) T-tests (one and two sample)
  - Uni vs. multi variate ANOVO
  - Factor analysis
  - Structural equation modeling
  - Inter-rater reliability
  - Linear regressions and corrilation coefficents
  - Hedge's g calculation and z-scores for standardized mean difference
  -h.) "leave-one-out" analysis
  -i.)Specificity scores
  -j.) tests of homogeneity
    - Q-tests
    - Chi-squared tests
    III.) I-squared
    IV.) Tau-squared

3.) Run each of the above tests with my simulated data in R

4.) Determine when to use the following graphs and create an elegent example of each in R (using simulaed data0
  a.) Scatter-plot
  b.) Histogram
  b.) Mosiac plot
  d.) Bar plot
  e.) Frequency distribuion
  f.) Density distribution
  g.) Forest Plots
  
5.) If I complete all of the above, I will look a aggregated effect sizes (fixed and random analysis)
